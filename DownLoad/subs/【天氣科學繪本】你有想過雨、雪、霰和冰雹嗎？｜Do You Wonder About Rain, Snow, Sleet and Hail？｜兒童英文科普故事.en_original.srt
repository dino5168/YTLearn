00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,160
Hi, I am Professor Mo's tour and I will

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:10,400
be telling you about water. You can call

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:14,480
it rain, you can call it snow, you can

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:17,680
call it sleep, you can call it hail, but

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,920
it's water all the same. Did you ever

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,960
wonder how old water is or where it

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,160
comes from? The answers may surprise

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,720
you. The next time you see a pond or

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,840
even a glass of water, think about how

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:35,680
old that water might be. Do you really

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:38,719
want to know? I thought you did. Did you

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,640
brush your teeth this morning? Well,

13
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,280
some of the water that you used could

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,520
have fallen from the sky yesterday or a

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:50,239
week or a month ago. It's pretty new.

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,320
But some part of that water is very old

17
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:56,079
and was around during the time of the

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,399
dinosaurs or even longer. Or maybe it's

19
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,359
a little newer like from the time when

20
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,800
the pharaohs were building

21
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,560
pyramids. You see there is only a

22
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,200
limited amount of water and it gets

23
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:12,640
recycled. Yeah. It keeps going round and

24
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:16,400
round that we call it the water cycle.

25
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,920
Yes. You have a question. No, it's not

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:23,119
like a jet ski or a bicycle for water.

27
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,479
It is nothing you can ride. It is how

28
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,320
water keeps going round and round. Let

29
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,320
me

30
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,040
explain. First, I would like to say that

31
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,680
water is very

32
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,560
important. Imagine an empty lake. The

33
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,360
fish would be very

34
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,360
unhappy. Imagine an empty ocean. Your

35
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,479
day at the beach would be like going to

36
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,960
a desert. And since you are mostly made

37
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:52,920
up of water, let's just say you would be

38
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:56,360
a lot lighter. The water cycle has four

39
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,960
parts. Evaporation, condensation,

40
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,479
precipitation,

41
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:04,240
collection. Evaporation. When the water

42
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:07,119
in an ocean, a lake, a pond, a river, or

43
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,800
a stream is heated by the sun, it turns

44
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:14,160
into vapor or steam. It then floats into

45
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:18,080
the air. Of course, when you are out on

46
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:22,560
a hot day or you exercise, you sweat.

47
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:25,040
Well, guess what? That evaporates, too.

48
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,720
What about those drops of dew on leaves

49
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,920
or the grass? Yes, they too evaporate

50
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,000
and become a part of the water

51
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,560
cycle. Condensation. As the water vapor

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,519
gets cooled, it changes back into a

53
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,200
liquid and turns into

54
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:43,840
clouds. Precipitation. When the air in

55
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,120
the clouds cannot hold any more liquid,

56
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,440
it falls back to the ground. It returns

57
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,519
in different ways depending on the

58
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:58,560
temperature and where it comes down. It

59
00:02:53,519 --> 00:03:00,760
can fall as rain or it can fall as snow.

60
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,239
Did you know that no two

61
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,720
snowflakes are the same? It can return

62
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:11,120
as sleet, which is like rain that has

63
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,440
almost frozen, or it can come as hail.

64
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,879
Those frozen balls of rain that can

65
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,519
actually break windows and dent cars.

66
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,879
Collection, no matter how it comes down,

67
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:26,400
it is collected and stored. It can fall

68
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:29,760
into the ocean, lake, pond, river, or

69
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,480
stream. If it lands on the ground, it

70
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,599
may roll into a river or be sucked up by

71
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,920
the soil. It may even pass through the

72
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,360
ground to an underground lake or river

73
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,680
to be used later. Now, what happens

74
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,879
tomorrow when the sun comes out? That's

75
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:52,080
right. The water cycle starts over

76
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:55,840
again. Oops, the sun is out. But don't

77
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,239
worry, Professor Ma's tour will return

78
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,239
after all. I am a part of the water

79
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,239
cycle.
