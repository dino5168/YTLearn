00:00:04,582 --> 00:00:06,617
once upon a time on the shore of the

3
00:00:06,618 --> 00:00:08,653
deep blue sea

4
00:00:08,654 --> 00:00:10,327
a fisherman and his wife were living in

5
00:00:10,328 --> 00:00:12,508
a tiny cottage

6
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,436
the fisherman used to go to the seaside

7
00:00:16,437 --> 00:00:19,417
every day and fish with his fishing rod

8
00:00:19,418 --> 00:00:24,218
he was quite content to live like this

9
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:27,563
but his wife was not as happy as he was

10
00:00:27,564 --> 00:00:31,054
ugh look at that disgusting cottage

11
00:00:31,055 --> 00:00:33,527
moldy and damp everywhere i am tired of

12
00:00:33,528 --> 00:00:35,781
cleaning every day

13
00:00:35,782 --> 00:00:38,472
the fisherman was very much in love with

14
00:00:38,473 --> 00:00:41,163
his wife but no matter what he did he

15
00:00:41,164 --> 00:00:43,999
could not make her happy

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,854
if he brings her fish she wants crab if

17
00:00:47,855 --> 00:00:50,254
he picks apples she craves pears

18
00:00:50,255 --> 00:00:53,235
one day the fisherman went fishing as

19
00:00:53,236 --> 00:00:55,854
usual he swung his fishing rod into the

20
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:58,326
water and started to wait

21
00:00:58,327 --> 00:01:00,945
after a few hours the tip of his fishing

22
00:01:00,946 --> 00:01:03,636
rod finally trembled

23
00:01:03,637 --> 00:01:04,727
oh a fish hit the hook but

24
00:01:04,728 --> 00:01:08,945

00:01:08,946 --> 00:01:11,926
this must be a stubborn big fish

26
00:01:11,927 --> 00:01:13,744
the fisherman pulled pulled pulled and

27
00:01:13,745 --> 00:01:16,654
was surprised to finally see the

28
00:01:16,655 --> 00:01:20,072
flounder on the tip of his fishing rod

29
00:01:20,073 --> 00:01:21,236
because this fish was golden and shining

30
00:01:21,237 --> 00:01:23,054
brightly

31
00:01:23,055 --> 00:01:24,362

the fisherman returned home with great

50
00:02:00,728 --> 00:02:03,054
