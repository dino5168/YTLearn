00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:07,279
once upon a time on the shore of the

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,519
deep blue sea

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,360
a fisherman and his wife were living in

5
00:00:11,361 --> 00:00:13,759
a tiny cottage

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,080
the fisherman used to go to the seaside

7
00:00:18,081 --> 00:00:21,359
every day and fish with his fishing rod

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,640
he was quite content to live like this

9
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:30,320
but his wife was not as happy as he was

10
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:34,160
ugh look at that disgusting cottage

11
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:36,880
moldy and damp everywhere i am tired of

12
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:39,360
cleaning every day

13
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:42,320
the fisherman was very much in love with

14
00:00:42,321 --> 00:00:45,280
his wife but no matter what he did he

15
00:00:45,281 --> 00:00:48,399
could not make her happy

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,640
if he brings her fish she wants crab if

17
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:55,280
he picks apples she craves pears

18
00:00:55,281 --> 00:00:58,559
one day the fisherman went fishing as

19
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,440
usual he swung his fishing rod into the

20
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:04,159
water and started to wait

21
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,040
after a few hours the tip of his fishing

22
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:10,000
rod finally trembled

23
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:11,200
oh a fish hit the hook but

24
00:01:11,201 --> 00:01:15,840

00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:19,119
this must be a stubborn big fish

26
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,119
the fisherman pulled pulled pulled and

27
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,320
was surprised to finally see the

28
00:01:24,321 --> 00:01:28,080
flounder on the tip of his fishing rod

29
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:29,360
because this fish was golden and shining

30
00:01:29,361 --> 00:01:31,360
brightly

31
00:01:31,361 --> 00:01:32,799

the fisherman returned home with great

50
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:15,360
